## Slypitime
Welcome! This repository is for the code running on the [Slypitime website](https://slypitime.com). 

### Purpose
There used to be a nice and simple web tool for calculating sleep cycles - it's much easier to wake up at the end of the cycle and you feel much better. Unfortunatelly, that website was bloated with analytics and renamed into some matress selling thing. This repository/website is a direct replacement - no data collection, no privacy intrusion. It's just a button to calculate time intervals. Enjoy.
